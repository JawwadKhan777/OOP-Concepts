# OOP-Concepts
**Objected-Oriented Programming:**
=================================
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes the concept of encapsulation, where data and the methods that operate on that data are bundled together within an object.

**Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
================================================
*Encapsulation:* Bundling data and methods together within an object to hide the internal details and provide a controlled interface.<br>
*Inheritance:* Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.<br>
*Polymorphism:* Treating objects of different classes as objects of a common superclass, enabling more generic and flexible code.<br>
*Abstraction:* Simplifying complex objects by capturing only relevant characteristics and behaviors, hiding unnecessary details.<br>
